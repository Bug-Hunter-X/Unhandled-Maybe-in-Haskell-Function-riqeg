The solution involves adding a pattern match for the `Nothing` case to handle the scenario where the `Maybe` value doesn't contain any data.  Here's the corrected code:
```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x
myFunction Nothing = 0 -- Handle the Nothing case
```
This revised function now gracefully handles both `Just` and `Nothing` cases, preventing runtime errors.
